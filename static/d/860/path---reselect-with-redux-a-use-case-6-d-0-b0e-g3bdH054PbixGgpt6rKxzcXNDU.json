In case of Redux it can help achieve a derived value from existing reducers instead of creating a new reducer for holding a derived value or fetching it from server.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrakBit/Images/master/selector.png\" alt=\"Reselect\"></p>\n<h2>Use Case: Search Deals in Redux Store</h2>\n<p>In the use case the user should be able to search the deals by the keywords he enters.</p>\n<h3>Possibility 1 : Query Server ❌</h3>\n<p>Initially I planned to query the server but that means making a request to the server on every keystroke and refreshing the redux store but it can be inefficient in terms of network.</p>\n<h3>Possibility 2 : Create Another Reducer ❌</h3>\n<p>Creating another reducer which holds the searched deals that but meant over complicating the redux store.</p>\n<h3>Possibility 3: Reselect ✅</h3>\n<p>There was reducer which hold the keywords that has been searched and another reducer holding all the deals.

Note how the entire state has been passed in filterDeal() so that it can have access to both dealReducer and dealSearchReducer.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Reselect with Redux: A Use Case","date":"December 02, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Reselect with Redux: A Use Case/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Flow - It’s Not Just About Static Typing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Flow: It’s Not Just About Static Typing"}},"next":null}}
